# Materials & Methods {#materials-methods}

The second chapter first describes the data collection during a cruise
in the Southern Ocean. Then how the acoustic record used in the thesis
is processed and analysed. The final part of the [Materials &
Methods](#materials-methods) focuses on treating the light data.

```

## Data Collection

The data used in the thesis originates from a cruise of a krill trawler
that fished in the Atlantic part of the Southern Ocean for eight months.
CCAMLR - the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
Resources regulates the krill fishery and is responsible for dividing
the Southern Ocean into fishing areas (fig.
\@ref(fig:CCAMLRConventionAreaMapAtlanticCropped)).

The vessel that collected the data was the "Antarctic Endurance" from
Aker BioMarine, a Norwegian company harvesting Antarctic krill. During
2020/21, the vessel fished in CCAMLR subareas 48.1, covering the
Bransfield and Gerlache Strait, and 48.2, which covers the waters north
of the South Orkney Islands.

The "Antarctic Endurance" is equipped with a hull-mounted ES80, Simrad
(echosounder) from Kongsberg, Maritime AS, Norway, with operating
frequencies of 38kHz and 200 kHz, that records constantly. An
*echosounder* is a device that uses sonar technology to measure physical
or biological components underwater. In this case, the sound recording
helps to detect krill swarms. The ship's echosounder recorded an
eight-month underwater acoustic dataset during the cruise. This dataset
forms the basis for the thesis.

```{r mapBathEcho, fig.cap = "Sampling Locations of the Acoustic Data", echo=FALSE, fig.align="left", out.extra="angle=0, scale =0.4"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figure/mapBathPupAcoustics.pdf")
```

The cruise route does not follow a systematical pattern but depends on
the vessel's fishing success. In December 2020, the "Antarctic
Endurance" fished the waters north of the South Orkney Islands and
transitioned into the Bransfield Strait. From there, it returned to the
South Orkney Islands in January. In March and April, the trawler crossed
the Bransfield Strait, coming from the waters around the South Orkney
Islands to the Gerlache Strait, where it harvested krill for a short
time. In late autumn (May), the vessel started its turn back to the
South Orkney Islands, which it reached in June (fig.
\@ref(fig:mapBathEcho)).

Light data taken during the cruise, at the surface and underwater,
complement the acoustic data record (Fig. \@ref(fig:mapBathLight)). From
4 May to 13 June, a light sensor, a RAMSES G2-ACC-VIS from TriOS Mess-
und Datentechnik GmbH, took a total of 88 atmospheric and eight
underwater light measurements. A software ("MSDA_XE") calibrated the raw
data for underwater and surface light measurements. The irradiance
record consists of intensities in W/m\textsuperscript{2} for a range of
wavelengths from 320 - 950 nm. In 10-second intervals, the sensor
collected the light data - at the surface at the highest point of the
fishery vessel and underwater attached to a CTD-Sonde. The CTD-Sonde was
fixed to a 200 m rope. The rope was lowered into the water in two-metre
steps for underwater measurements. Because of drifting, the CDT-Sonde
reached its deepest point at \~188 m water depth.

In the following two sections, the processing of the acoustic data and
the handling of the light data are discussed in more detail.

## Acoustic Data

The chapter describes the workflow of acoustic data processing. For the
analysis, we used the R programming language [@Rcore].

The acoustic data consist of multiple files that store information on
time, depth and backscattering intensity. Figure
\@ref(fig:rawAcousticsThesis) visualises a typical acoustic record (Here
from the beginning of February). The backscattering signal contains four
different essential features (highlighted by the corresponding numbers):

1.  Residues from the preprocessing (described in [From Screenshot to
    Dataset])
2.  Sea floor
3.  Krill signal
4.  Instrument noise that amplifies with increasing depth

To analyse the krill record, one must exclude all other influences. The
following section describes the data-cleaning process to isolate the
krill signal. Figure \@ref(fig:cropedWorkflow) provides an overview of
the whole process.

```{r rawAcousticsThesis, fig.cap = "Acoustic record of relative backscattering values",echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.extra="angle=0, scale =.95"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figure/rawAcousticsThesis.pdf")
```

```{=html}
<!--
the next section of the data processing 
-->
```
### From Screenshot to Dataset

To reach the state of fig \@ref(fig:rawAcousticsThesis), the following
preprocessing step is necessary. Due to a faulty onboard recording
system, no raw data from the acoustic record is available. Therefore,
the acoustic dataset was reconstructed from more than 18,000
screenshots. These screenshots contain the whole time series of
backscattering data. They are stored automatically by krillViz, an
Aker-internal system that allows exchanging information on krill stock
between the own fishing fleet.

\clearpage

```{r cropedWorkflow, fig.cap = "Steps of the Data Pipe to process the acoustic data", echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.extra="angle=0, scale =1.75"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figure/cropWorkSolLast.pdf")
```

\clearpage

RGB values were matched for every pixel in the screenshots based on the
colour scale used for the visualisations. The colour values of the
original scale can be reviewed on the support website for "Echoview"
(<https://support.echoview.com/WebHelp/Using_Echoview/Echogram/About_color_schemes.htm#EK80_colors>).

```{=html}
<!--
maybe figure for colour scheme
-->
```
Then the extracted colour value of each pixel within the screenshots was
matched with the closest value of the colour scheme using the Euclidean
Distance of red, blue, and green. The relative position on the colour
scheme assigns a value between 0 and 1 to every pixel of the screenshots
(fig. \@ref(fig:rgbArray)).

```{r rgbArray, fig.cap = "Reconstruction of relative backscattering values", echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.extra="angle=0, scale =.3"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figure/rgbArray.png")
```

The depth information for every pixel was calculated by multiplying the
relative vertical position from 0 to 1 with the maximum depth recorded
in the screenshot. Linear scaling of the relative horizontal position
helped to reconstruct the time information. The visually extracted time
information made it possible to define the time interval. The "goodness
of fit" was inspected visually. Figure \@ref(fig:transformImages) shows
a comparison of one screenshot and the corresponding file after
transformation. The result is an acoustic record of multiple files that
contain relative backscattering values (fig.
\@ref(fig:rawAcousticsThesis)). The reconstructed datasets contain
residues from the screenshots - like times that are displayed on the
screens - that need to be removed from the datasets (described in
[Visual Removal of Remnants])

```{r transformImages, fig.cap = "Comparison between screenshot and reconstructed data", echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.extra="angle=0, scale =.3"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figure/transformImages.png")
```

```{=html}

### Unifying Depth- & Time-Scales

Since depth and time were reconstructed on relative scales for every
data file, it was necessary to unify the steps of both variables across
multiple datasets. The time is resolved in three-minute steps, and the
depth in 0.67 m steps. The means of the combined/downsampled
backscattered values were calculated to avoid losing information about
the acoustic signal. Times that do not contain information on krill are
excluded from further analysis by visual control.

```{=html}
<!--
the next section of the data processing 
-->
```
### Sea Floor Detection

The removal of the sea floor is an essential point in the process of
freeing the krill signal from external influences. As soon as sea floor
is present in the data, the algorithm recognises it and marks the
respective depth (fig. \@ref(fig:seaFloorAcousticsThesis)). In this
analysis step, only the sea floor's initialisation takes place. The
actual removal happens after the denoising part of the process (fig.
\@ref(fig:cropedWorkflow)). The applied line-picking algorithm divides
into four steps, highlighted in fig. \@ref(fig:seaFloorPickingSchem).

```{r seaFloorAcousticsThesis, fig.cap = "Line picking algorithm applied to the data example",echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.extra="angle=0, scale =.95"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figure/seaFloorAcousticsThesis.pdf")
```

The steps of the algorithm:

1.  Search within the depth limits of the customised selection to find
    the sample with maximum backscattering strength. The maximum depth
    is set to the full depth range of the dataset by default. This is
    done to reduce the possibility of picking an artefact from the
    vessel as the sea floor.

2.  Then the algorithm defines a minimum backscattering value for a
    "good" bottom line pick.

3.  A search interval between the maximum backscattering value and the
    minimum depth is searched for a discriminant value that defines the
    last signal of the sea floor and therefore represents the bottom.

4.  If the maximum backscattering value is marked as a good fit for the
    sea floor, the index of the discriminant value appears to be the sea
    floor. Else, no bottom is recognised by the algorithm.

### Denoising

The denoising section of the thesis leads through the steps that are
necessary to remove background noise from the acoustic record.

#### *Algorithm Summary* {.unlisted .unnumbered}

The denoising part of the data cleaning process is essential to isolate
biomass signals from instrument noise that both have been received from
the transducer. Here the method is based on the proposed post-processing
technic to remove background noise of @AbDeRobertis2007.\
The algorithm assumes that a portion of the signal is dominated by
background noise. Therefore, it estimates the background noise for every
sample and subtracts the calculated noise value from the received
signal.

The algorithm divides into four main parts that are described in detail
below. During the first step, the backscattering score is transformed,
based on the physical properties of the seawater, into a value in dB
(decibel). Second, the converted signal is used to estimate the noise
for every sample by averaging over a particular grid cell (fig.
\@ref(fig:denoisngSmallScaleSchematic)). The size of the grid cell is
individually selected per data set and the extent is defined by time and
depth. The third step is to correct high noise levels by setting a
maximum value and utilising it when it is exceeded. In the end, the
estimated noise gets subtracted from the measured backscattering value.
Figure \@ref(fig:denoisedAcousticsThesis) shows an example of a
noise-free echogram.

```{r denoisedAcousticsThesis, fig.cap = "Acoustic Data with noise removed",echo=FALSE, fig.align="left", out.extra="angle=0, scale =.95"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figure/denoisedAcousticsThesis.pdf")
```

#### *Converting Intensity Scores in dB-Values* {.unlisted .unnumbered}

First, the relative backscatter values (1 to 0) were re-scaled from 0 to
-70 dB (the decibel values correspond to the colour scale used for
processing the screenshots). The newly generated values correspond to
the measured mean volume backscatter strength ($S_{v, meas}$), that
should have been received by the transducer.

After the conversion, the actual backscattering strength was calculated
by removing the influences of signal absorption in the water and the
range-dependent time-varied gain (TVG). (Details are in the Appendix A:
[Calculation of the TVG and Range Amplification])

The calculated power ($Power_{cal}$) is the logarithmic measure of the
received power ($S_{v, meas}$), adjusted for environmental factors and
echosounder characteristics (details on echosounder characteristics and
environmental factors are in [Calculation of the TVG and Range
Amplification]). The power ($Power_{cal}$) is calculated as follows:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
 Power_{cal}(i,j) &= S_{v, meas}(i,j) - (20 log_{10}(r_{tvg}(i,j)) + 2 \alpha r_{tvg}(i,j)).
\end{split}
(\#eq:PowerCal)
\end{equation}
```
$S_{v, meas}(i,j)$ is the backscattering strength at one position,
$r_{tvg}(i,j)$ represents the range amplification, and $\alpha$ stands
for the absorption coefficient (sound absorption coefficient that
depends on environmental factors). Afterwards, the formula,

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
 Power_{cal, trans}(i,j) &= 10^{Power_{cal}(i,j)/10}
\end{split}
(\#eq:PowerCalTrans)
\end{equation}
```
transforms the value back into decibels. $Power_{cal, trans}$ represent
the actual backscattering values (in decibels) freed from environmental
and echosounder influences.

#### *Noise Estimations* {.unlisted .unnumbered}

The algorithm analyses the echogram of the $Power_{cal, trans}$-values
by averaging over a grid cell with a fixed horizontal and vertical
extent. The noise estimate for every ping is the average of its cell.
The sliding cell does not shrink at the ends of the echogram. Therefore,
the pings on the side can not be corrected while appearing in the middle
of the averaging window. Figure \@ref(fig:denoisngSmallScaleSchematic)
describes the process. The mean of the values within the grid cell are
the noise of the ping.

```{r denoisngSmallScaleSchematic, fig.cap = "Averaging intervall of a grid cell",echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.extra="angle=0, scale =1"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figure/denoisngSmallScaleSchematic.pdf")
```

#### *Maximum Threshold Noise* {.unlisted .unnumbered}

A maximum threshold is applied to the calculated noise estimates for
high noise estimations.

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
 if \; \; Noise(i, j) > Noise_{max} \; \; 
\Rightarrow \; \; Noise(i, j) = Noise_{max}
\end{split}
(\#eq:noiseEst)
\end{equation}
```
#### *Noise Removal* {.unlisted .unnumbered}

In the end, the noise estimates ($S_{v, noise}$) are calculated by
adding the amplification effect and the absorption coefficient:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
 S_{v, noise}(i,j) &= Noise(i, j) + (20 log_{10}(r_{tvg}(i,j)) + 2 \alpha r_{tvg}(i,j)).
\end{split}
(\#eq:noiseSv)
\end{equation}
```
The estimated noise is subtracted from $S_{v, meas}$ to obtain the noise
corrected value ($S_{v, corr}$) by:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
 S_{v, corr}(i,j) &= 10 log_{10}(10^{S_{v, meas}(i,j)/10} - 10^{S_{v, noise}(i,j)/10}).
\end{split}
(\#eq:PowerCalTrans)
\end{equation}
```

### Visual Removal of Remnants

At this stage, the data sets look as like in figure
\@ref(fig:denoisedAcousticsThesis) In order to obtain a satisfactory
final result that only includes the krill signal, the seabed, top
metres, and obvious disturbance factors must be removed. The uppermost
section of the echogram is dominated by the ship's echo and the
influence of waves. In this particular case, remnants from the
screenshot processing contribute to the disturbance shortly below the
surface. In addition, some time series segments that do not contain a
relevant krill signal are removed.

For every echogram, one can review the manually omitted sections in the file cleaningInput.xlsx. (not entirely sure where to include it, later maybe in the appendix)
Here, the denosing part is over and the metrics calculation start
-->
```
### Metrics

Three metrics describe the eight months-spanning datasets selected to
characterize the behaviour of Antarctic krill over time. The vessel
(Antarctic Endurance) exclusively fished for Antarctic krill. Therefore,
we assume that the biomass signal in our dataset does, to a large
extent, represent Antarctic krill and no other organisms. From the
backscattering signal, the herein metrics were derived to describe the
vertical structure and the dynamics of krill swarms [@Bez;
@Woillez2007].

```{=html}
<!--
Centre Of Mass
-->
```
##### *Centre of Mass (CM)*

is an indicator for the vertical position of krill. It describes the
mean location of the swarm in the water column [@Bez; @Urmy2012]. It is
the average of all depths sampled weighted by their backscattering
values:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
 CM &= \frac{\int \: z \cdot s_v(z) \: dz} {\int \: s_v(z) \: dz},
\end{split}
(\#eq:centreOfMass)
\end{equation}
```
where $z$ is the depth and $S_v(z)$ is the backscattering intensity at
depth $z$.

```{=html}
<!--
Inertia
-->
```
##### *Inertia (I)*

[@Bez] measures the dispersion or spread of the krill signal around the
$CM$. It is a simple way to measure the spatial variability of a given
distribution. High values indicate large and loosely packed swarms.

It is the sum of the squared distances from the $CM$, weighted by the
$S_v(z)$ at each distance and normalised by the total backscattering
signal ($\int \: s_v(z) \: dz$):

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
 I &= \frac{\int \: (z - CM)^2 \cdot s_v(z) \: dz} {\int \: s_v(z) \: dz}.
\end{split}
(\#eq:inertia)
\end{equation}
```
```{=html}
<!--
Evenness
-->
```
##### *Evenness (E)*

is a measure to describe the area krill would occupy if all data cells
contained the mean density at a single time stamp. It equals the measure
of space over which a population would spread if it had the same density
distribution. It is calculated as the squared integral of the
backscattering strength in one ping divided by the depth integral:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
 E &= \frac{(\int \: s_v(z) \: dz)^2} {\int \: s_v(z)^2 \: dz}.
\end{split}
(\#eq:evenness)
\end{equation}
```
In combination with the *Inertia*, it is a good approximation for a
swarm´s density.

### Solar Angle Calculations

The solar angle is an excellent predictor of information on krill swarm
behaviour under changing light. The sun's elevation angle describes the
angle between rays emitted by the sun and a horizontal plane
[@Kalogirou2022]. For every timestamp considered for further analysis, a
geographical identifier - position in longitude and latitude - was
assigned to the data. The coordinates originate from the ship's log
file. The finely resolved coordinates were summarised and assigned to
the closest acoustic record to add a location to every backscattering
value. For every position defined by coordinates and time, the
corresponding solar angle was calculated using the 'suncalc'-package
[@Thieurmel2019] in R [@Rcore].

\clearpage

```{=html}
<!--
Here the part of the light data analysis starts 
-->
```
## Light Data

The light data sampled during the cruise intend to describe krill
behaviour under changing underwater light conditions. Since light data
is available from 4 May to 13 June, only the time between the two dates
is considered for the light analysis. The aim is to calculate underwater
light models for every region to predict the underwater light regime. In
the first section of the light data analysis, the discrete surface
measurements are translated into descriptive functions to obtain a
continuous wavelength-specific intensity across the day. This step is
necessary because the continuous surface light serves as input for the
underwater light models. These models are based on underwater
measurements and calculated in the second part of the light data
analysis.

### Surface Measurements

Discrete measured values at the surface (fig.
\@ref(fig:surfaceInputDis)) had to be transformed into a descriptive
function to obtain a continuous course of the wavelength-specific light
intensities. Based on exploratory data analysis, Gaussian functions fit
the daily light dynamics:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
 E(\lambda,t) &= k \cdot \exp(-0.5 \cdot \frac{t - \mu}{\sigma^2}).
\end{split}
(\#eq:gauss)
\end{equation}
```
Here, $\mu$ stands for the solar noon, assuming that the daily light
intensity reaches its maximum at the sun's highstand (red line in fig.
\@ref(fig:surfaceInputDis)). The variable $k$ defines the height of the
curve's peak, and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the curve to
control the width. The intensity $E(\lambda,t)$ depends on the time $t$
and is unique for each wavelength $\lambda$. For all days including
surface measurements, the solar noon was calculated with the
'suncalc'-package by @Thieurmel2019. Wavelengths larger than 600 nm and
smaller than 350 nm were discarded from the analysis.

```{=html}

knitr::include_graphics(path = "figure/surfaceInputDis.pdf")
```

### Underwater Light Models

The goal is to establish one underwater light model for each of the
three study regions. The underwater light models are trained based on
the underwater profile measurements. The profiles consist of measured
light intensity values (in W/m\textsuperscript{2}) over depths up to
\~188 m. In total, eight profiles are available. Through visual checks
of the light profiles, three of the eight profiles were excluded for
further analyses and restricted to only downcast data (data measured
during the descent).

Fig. \@ref(fig:exploratoryLightProfiles) illustrates the intensity data
of the five remaining profiles with their corresponding depth. The
intensity on the x-axis of the graph is logarithmic.

With increasing depth, the intensity decrease of the logarithmic values
is linear. Accordingly, the log-transformed intensities serve as input
for a linear attenuation model.

The profiles from 4 May serve as training data for a model used to
predict underwater light at the Gerlache Strait, the profiles from 11
and 16 May for the Bransfield Strait model and the profile from 12 June
for the South Orkney Islands (fig. \@ref(fig:exploratoryLightProfiles)).

With those five profiles, linear models calculate the
wavelength-specific attenuation coefficient ($K_d$) for every region.
The attenuation coefficient determines how quickly a particular
wavelength loses intensity with increasing depth. The models only
consider wavelengths between 350 nm and 600 nm, as in the surface
measurements. Based on the sensors detection limit, values below 0.0125
W/m\textsuperscript{2} are assumed to be measurement noise and excluded
from the analysis.

The aim of the three regional models is to estimate the
wavelength-specific underwater light fields and relate the behaviour of
krill to daily changes in light intensities.

The surface values calculated in the section [Surface Measurements]
serve as input to predict the underwater light intensity for about six
weeks - the time between the first and last recorded light measurement.
Only measured values were used to predict underwater light regimes for
simplicity and to avoid uncertainties. In order to cover the available
range of light intensities, the day with the most intensive and the day
with the lowest solar radiation were taken as reference values.
Accordingly, underwater intensities were determined for both cases.

The wavelength dependent-intensity was calculated as a function of depth
($z$),

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
 E_d(\lambda,z) &= E(\lambda,t) \cdot \exp(K_d(\lambda) \cdot z),
\end{split}
(\#eq:extinction)
\end{equation}
```
where $E(\lambda,t)$ is the surface radiance at time ($t$) and $K_d$ the
wavelength and region-specific attenuation coefficient. For abstraction,
it is assumed that the radiation measured at the surface penetrates
completely into the water column. However, with exponential decrease,
the loss of accuracy at great depths is minimal.

#### *Isolumen* - {.unlisted .unnumbered}

lines of equal light intensities at one wavelength - are calculated for
a lower limit of photo behaviour in Antarctic krill. Information on
light sensitivity data for *E. superba* is lacking. Therefore, the study
relies on findings from other Euphausiids. @Cohen2015a reported a
maximum light sensitivity at wavelength 487 nm for the Arctic species
*Thysanoessa inermis*. An Isolumen at wavelength 487 nm and an intensity
of 2.3 x 10\textsuperscript{-4} µmol m\textsuperscript{-2}
s\textsuperscript{-1} is used to calculate the Isolumen
